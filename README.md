## Setting Up Environment Variables

This project requires an OpenAI API key to function. You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before running the application.

### Using Environment Variables Directly

You can set the environment variable in your terminal:

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
